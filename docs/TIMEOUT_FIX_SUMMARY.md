# Export Timeout Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The export domains functionality was failing with "Internal Server Error" due to PHP timeout limits:
- **Error**: `Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded in api.php on line 16`
- **Root Cause**: Processing 200 domains per batch with individual API calls for nameservers exceeded the 30-second PHP execution limit

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. PHP Timeout Configuration
**File**: `export_domains.php`
- Added timeout configuration at the top of the file:
  ```php
  ini_set('max_execution_time', 300); // 5 minutes
  ini_set('memory_limit', '512M'); // Increase memory limit
  set_time_limit(300); // Set script timeout to 5 minutes
  ```

### 2. Reduced Batch Size
**File**: `export_domains.php`
- Changed batch size from 200 to 50 domains per batch
- Updated all UI references to reflect the new batch size
- This reduces processing time per batch significantly

### 3. API Timeout Optimization
**File**: `api.php`
- Increased cURL timeout from 30 to 60 seconds
- Added better error handling for timeout scenarios

### 4. Processing Optimizations
**File**: `export_domains.php`
- Reduced delay between API calls from 0.25 to 0.1 seconds
- Added timeout reset during processing loop
- Enhanced error messages for timeout scenarios

### 5. Better Error Handling
- Added specific timeout error detection
- Improved progress reporting
- Added timeout protection indicators

## Expected Results
- Export process should now complete without timeout errors
- Each batch processes 50 domains instead of 200
- Total processing time per batch: ~2-3 minutes (instead of timing out)
- Better user feedback during the export process

## Testing
1. Navigate to Export Domains page
2. Try exporting Batch 1 (50 domains)
3. Process should complete successfully without timeout errors
4. CSV file will be generated with domain and nameserver data

## Files Modified
- `export_domains.php` - Main export functionality with timeout fixes
- `api.php` - API timeout configuration
- `test_export_timeout.php` - Test script to verify fixes

## Next Steps
If you still experience timeouts:
1. Further reduce batch size to 25 domains
2. Implement asynchronous processing
3. Add domain filtering to reduce API calls
4. Consider implementing a queue system for large exports
