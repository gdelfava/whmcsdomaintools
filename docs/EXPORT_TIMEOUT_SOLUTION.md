# Export Timeout Solution (Working)

## Problem Resolved
The app was broken due to invalid `.htaccess` configuration. The `.htaccess` file has been removed and the app is now working again.

## Working Solution: Progress-Based Export

Since MAMP's FastCGI timeout cannot be easily overridden via `.htaccess`, the best solution is to use the **progress-based export system** that avoids long-running requests entirely.

### How It Works
- **File**: `export_progress.php`
- **Method**: AJAX-based processing
- **Each request**: Processes only 1 domain (under 30 seconds)
- **Progress**: Real-time feedback via JavaScript
- **No timeouts**: Each request is short enough to avoid FastCGI timeout

### Usage Instructions
1. **Navigate to**: `http://localhost:8888/domain-tools-fridge/export_progress.php`
2. **Enter batch number** (e.g., 2 for domains 51-100)
3. **Click "Start Export"**
4. **Watch progress** as domains are processed one by one
5. **No timeout errors** since each request is short

### Features
- ✅ **Real-time progress bar**
- ✅ **Individual domain processing**
- ✅ **Error handling per domain**
- ✅ **No FastCGI timeout issues**
- ✅ **Works with any batch size**

## Alternative: Original Export with Optimizations

The original export at `main_page.php?view=export` has been optimized with:
- Reduced batch size (50 domains)
- Increased PHP timeouts
- Better error handling
- Faster processing delays

However, it may still timeout on larger batches due to FastCGI limitations.

## Recommendation

**Use the progress-based export system** (`export_progress.php`) for reliable, timeout-free exports. It's the most robust solution for MAMP's FastCGI configuration.

## Files Status
- ✅ `.htaccess` - Removed (was causing 500 errors)
- ✅ `export_progress.php` - Working progress-based export
- ✅ `main_page.php` - Optimized with PHP timeout settings
- ✅ `export_domains.php` - Optimized with PHP timeout settings
