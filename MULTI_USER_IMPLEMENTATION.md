# Multi-User Implementation Documentation

## 🎯 Overview

The application has been successfully converted to a multi-user system where each user only sees their own data. This ensures complete data isolation and security between users.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates

**Updated Tables:**
- `domains` - Added `user_email` field
- `domain_nameservers` - Added `user_email` field
- `sync_logs` - Already had `user_email` field
- `user_settings` - Already had `user_email` field

**Key Changes:**
- All tables now include user filtering
- Unique constraints updated to include user_email
- Indexes added for user_email for performance

### 2. Database Method Updates

**Updated Methods:**
- `insertDomain($userEmail, $domainData)` - Now requires user email
- `insertNameservers($userEmail, $domainId, $nameservers)` - Now requires user email
- `getDomains($userEmail, ...)` - Now filters by user
- `getDomainCount($userEmail, ...)` - Now filters by user
- `getDomainStats($userEmail)` - Now filters by user
- `getUniqueRegistrars($userEmail)` - Now filters by user

### 3. Application Updates

**Files Updated:**
- `main_page.php` - All database calls now include user filtering
- `domains_db.php` - Updated to use user-specific queries
- `domain_sync.php` - Sync operations now user-specific
- `simple_sync.php` - Sync operations now user-specific
- `test_with_sample_data.php` - Test data now user-specific

## 🔒 Security Features

### Data Isolation
- Each user only sees their own domains
- Settings are completely isolated per user
- Sync logs are user-specific
- No cross-user data leakage

### Authentication Required
- All database operations require valid user session
- User email is validated before any data access
- Session-based authentication maintained

## 🚀 Multi-User Benefits

### For Users
- **Complete Privacy**: Each user's data is completely isolated
- **Personal Settings**: API credentials and preferences per user
- **Independent Operations**: Syncs and operations don't affect other users
- **Cross-Device Access**: Settings persist across devices for same user

### For Administrators
- **Scalable Architecture**: Multiple users can use the same application
- **Secure Separation**: No risk of data cross-contamination
- **Easy Management**: Each user manages their own data independently
- **Audit Trail**: All operations are user-specific and traceable

## 📊 Database Schema

### Domains Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE domains (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    domain_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    domain_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    registrar VARCHAR(100),
    expiry_date DATE,
    registration_date DATE,
    next_due_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    currency VARCHAR(3),
    notes TEXT,
    batch_number INT DEFAULT 1,
    last_synced TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    INDEX idx_user_email (user_email),
    UNIQUE KEY unique_user_domain (user_email, domain_id)
);
```

### Domain Nameservers Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE domain_nameservers (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    domain_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    ns1 VARCHAR(255),
    ns2 VARCHAR(255),
    ns3 VARCHAR(255),
    ns4 VARCHAR(255),
    ns5 VARCHAR(255),
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    INDEX idx_user_email (user_email),
    UNIQUE KEY unique_user_domain (user_email, domain_id)
);
```

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Getting User's Domains
```php
$userEmail = $_SESSION['user_email'];
$domains = $db->getDomains($userEmail, $page, $perPage, $search, $status);
```

### Inserting User's Domain
```php
$userEmail = $_SESSION['user_email'];
$domainData = [
    'domain_id' => '123',
    'domain_name' => 'example.com',
    'status' => 'Active',
    // ... other fields
];
$db->insertDomain($userEmail, $domainData);
```

### Getting User's Statistics
```php
$userEmail = $_SESSION['user_email'];
$stats = $db->getDomainStats($userEmail);
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Migration Script
Use `migrate_to_multi_user.php` to:
- Verify user settings exist
- Test multi-user functionality
- Complete the migration process

### Test Data
Use `test_with_sample_data.php` to:
- Insert sample data for current user
- Test all database operations
- Verify user isolation

## 📋 Migration Steps

1. **Database Schema Update**
   - Run `database.php` to create updated tables
   - New tables include user_email fields

2. **Application Updates**
   - All database calls updated to include user email
   - User session validation added

3. **User Verification**
   - Use migration script to verify setup
   - Test with sample data

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

- [ ] User can only see their own domains
- [ ] Settings are user-specific
- [ ] Sync operations are isolated
- [ ] No cross-user data access
- [ ] Session authentication works
- [ ] Database queries filter by user
- [ ] Sample data works for current user

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Security
- Always validate user session before database operations
- Never expose other users' data
- Use prepared statements for all queries
- Encrypt sensitive user data

### Performance
- User_email indexes added for fast queries
- Batch operations remain efficient
- Caching can be user-specific

### Maintenance
- Regular backups include user data
- Monitor database size per user
- Consider data retention policies
